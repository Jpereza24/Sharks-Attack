# Sharks-Attack

In this project I started with a database where there are registered more or less 6000 shark attacks since the 16th century.
I have cleaned up the database with pandas keeping only all those attacks registered in the last 100 years in the 5 countries with more number of attacks.

My hypothesis was based on the idea that in the last 20 years were fewer attacks because of the massive fishing and the damage of the oceans. However, seeing the data I got, I realized that I was wrong in my hypothesis. I think that the reason is because of the technological advances that allow to record more attacks in an easier way.

That is the reason why I decided to analyze in more depth the last 25 years to see if I could at least observe a negative trend in that period of time. I have analyzed in the total database and the particular country database and although is true that in 2016 there were fewer recorded attacks than in 2015, an ascending trend can be seen in the last 25 years, the only exception to this ascending trend is Brazil where it seems that there have been less attacks in the recent years than in the early 90s. I think that one reason for the increasing number of attacks could be the damage of the offshore ecosystems that forces the sharks to get closer to the coast to hunt and therefore have greater contact with humans.
